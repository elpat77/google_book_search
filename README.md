# full-stack-template


This is the basic Full-Stack app set-up using react. 

To use it: 
Clone it into your local machine
Launch it with VS code

Outside the client Folder:
npm install
npm init -y 

Change into the client folder:
cd client
npm install
npm init -y 


While in the client folder you can run:
npm start - Verify app loads correctly
stop that server

cd out of the client folder.
 
run: 
npm run client  - Verify app loads correctly
stop that server

run npm run dev - Verify app loads correctly

If the app launches everything is working fine and is ready to use this template!
